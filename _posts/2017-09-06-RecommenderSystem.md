title: A Simple and Effective Recommender System
---
I love watching movies as much as I love reading. Because of that I subscribe a movie streaming service. 
This service sends me movies recommendations weekly. It also gives me recommendation every time I access its platform - Great! Well, not so great... 
It actually recommends movies that I have ALREADY WATCHED most of times... :( 

After getting tired of having recommendation of movies I have already watched I decided to create my own movie recommender system.
I know there are tons of recommender systems out there, I just wanted something tailored for my needs, so I built a simple one, but
with that glaring detail that is forgotten by many systems: It will never recommend me a movie I have already watched!

Here is the link for the [github repository] (https://github.com/flaviobossolan/Recommender).

I have an ipython notebook in Kaggle with more recent data in [this link]. (https://www.kaggle.com/flaviobossolan/simple-efficient-movie-recommender/)

That's the idea: to solve even the simplest problems with data...
