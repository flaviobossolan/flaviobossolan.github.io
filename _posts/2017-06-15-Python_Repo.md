This is an ongoing project not a tutorial, however one day it could become one...
In [this link](https://github.com/flaviobossolan/Python-Repo) I share some Python scripts that are useful and handy for me.

It was compiled little by little and I try to keep it organized and simple, just for reference.

Here are some Topics:

### Machine Learning:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVMs
- Cross-validation
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boost Classifiers and Regressors
- Neural Nets
- PCA and Clustering
- Grid search for fine tuning

### Exploratory Analysis:
- SQL-like functions in Python
- Spotting outliers with IQR
- Hypothesis Tests: 
  - Anova and post-hoc Tuckey test
  - Pearson Correlation
  - Chi Squared
- Regression Analysis with Statsmodels
