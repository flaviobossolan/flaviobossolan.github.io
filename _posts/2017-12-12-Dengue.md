title: Predicting Dengue Fever
---
Recently I developed a script trying to predict new dengue fever outbreaks using historical data from Peru and Puerto Rico. Sometimes I want to do data analysis for good. Who never dreamed in solving a world problem?
First I did some exploratory analysis to find out which variables to use and a good approach to the problem.

After exploring the data, it became clear that temperature and air humidity played a big role in outbreaks... I tried a linear model but it predicted poorly.
I then tried a gradient boosting regressor and it did a pretty good job.

In this [github repo](https://github.com/flaviobossolan/Dengue-Fever) you can find the script, datasets and a final report.
