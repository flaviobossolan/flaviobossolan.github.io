### Hi, I'm Flavio. I like to solve problems with data.
I am from Brazil and I have more than 6 years of experience with data analysis and data mining. I have worked in Credit Risk and Marketing, in the Banking and Telecom Industry. I like to develop new solutions and and analyze data.

Here I want to try to organize some personal solutions I developed using data science. Since the solutions I come up with at work are disclosed, here I just post what I do on my free time...

I developed and maintain the Python Package simpleDOE - a Python package for designing and measuring experiments with tests of proportions (such as A/B tests and marketing campaigns). You can find simpleDOE at [Python Software Foundation pypi] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpleDOE/1.0) and the official package web page with more info [here] (https://flaviobossolan.github.io/simpleDOE/).

I am a certified [SAS Statistical Analyst with Regression and Modeling](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification/credentials/advanced-analytics/statistical-business-analyst.html), although I develop most of my solutions using Python.
