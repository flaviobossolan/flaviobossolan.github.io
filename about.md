###Hi, I'm Flavio. I like to solve problems with data.
I have more than 6 years of experience with data analysis and data mining. I like to develop new solutions and and analyze data.

Here I want to try to organize some personal solutions I developed using data science. Since the solutions I come up with at work are disclosed, here I just post what I do on my free time...

I am a SAS Statistical Analyst with Regression and Modeling Certified, although I develop many of my solutions using Python.
